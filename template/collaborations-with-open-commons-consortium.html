		<p>
		Matsu is a collaboration between NASA and the Open Commons Consortium to develop open source technology for cloud-based processing of satellite imagery to support the earth sciences. The OSDC is used to process Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite imagery from the Advanced Land Imager and the Hyperion instruments and to make this data available to interested users. We are currently working on developing services for detecting fires and floods and getting relevant information to first responders.
